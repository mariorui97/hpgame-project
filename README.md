# Harry Potter - the boy who coded
A 2d game based on the Harry Potter movie saga - designed to module 0 of Ironhack Bootcamp where Harry Potter faces his enemies (well, initially only *the one whose name shall not be pronounced*) in a duel to the death - dodging avada kedavras as long as possible. Harry haves 7 lives (number of hocruxes) and if you get hit by a spell, you will lose one. Time's increasing also increase your points.
